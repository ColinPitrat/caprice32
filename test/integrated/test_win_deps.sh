# The idea of this test is to ensure no new DLL dependency is added involuntarly.
# All needed DLLs should be included in the archive.
#
# If the test fails, the package needs to be verified manually under windows or
# wine to see if a DLL needs to be added to it. If so, it needs to be added to
# the DLLS variable in makefile.
