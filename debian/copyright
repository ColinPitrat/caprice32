 Copyright FAQ
 =============
 .
    1. I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?
 .
       Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its
       competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system
       and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money
       from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to
       do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package,
       however.
 .
    2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and
       sale as part of a larger software package or system.  Can I do so?
 .
       Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a "larger software package" to begin 
       with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. 
       See 1. above.
 .
    3. Are derivative works allowed?
       Yes!
 .
    4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?
       Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).
 .
    5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?
 .
       You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the
       quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to
       ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these
       names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig,
       substitutions could still could have occurred during font
       opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional
       copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!
 .
    6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get 
        adopted in future versions?
 .
       Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has
       provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to
       the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such
       additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the
       entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep
       both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add
       glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's
       design. Vera cannot become a "ransom note" font. Jim Lyles will be
       providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a
       guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.
 .
    7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?
 .
       Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software
       with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.
 .
    8. If applications have built the names "Bitstream Vera" into them, 
       can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?
 .
       This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source
       systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to
       use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration,
       selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font
       names and subsituting alternatives. An example is provided by the
       supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for
       "sans", "serif" and "monospace".  Other software (e.g., the XFree86
       core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.
