   May 19, 2004 - 23:13 removed all DirectX/Windows specific parts and replaced them (wherever possible) with the SDL equivalent
   May 23, 2004 - 17:48 dropped double buffer scheme in favour of a back buffer/custom blit operation; fixed colour palette init in 8bpp mode; added support for half size render mode; back buffer is cleared in video_init(); replaced the SDL_Flip operation with an SDL_BlitSurface; initial ExitCondition is now EC_FRAME_COMPLETE to ensure we have a valid video memory pointer to start with
   May 24, 2004 - 00:49 reintroduced snapshot_load & snapshot_save; modified vdu_init to update the two SDL_Rect structures to center or crop the CPC screen; introduced the dwXScale var to support the half size render mode
   May 29, 2004 - 18:09 reintroduced tape_eject, tape_insert and tape_insert_voc; added sound support via the native SDL audio routines
